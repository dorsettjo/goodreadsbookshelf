GoodReads Research (with attention to the purpose of the bookshelf and the pros and cons of both functionality and aesthetics)

So, it let me think it was going to let me browse without joining and then the create account page popped up.. turnoff.....
The Readers online now section made me doubt their privacy.

Friends and Fam
Jessica: On mobile. It looks like a good concept. Not familiar with it.
Laurlei: I am using my I-pad. Site is very informative in so many ways. You could set up your own library, catalog your books, start book clubs ,post your reviews etc.  it really is amazing. I would recommend it to everyone who is a book lover
Mary: I have been on Goodreads.com for years and have it both on my mobile app and on my computer. Not sure what you want me to look at ...I like Goodreads.com because it's a great way for me to track what I've read and also find new books that I probably would've never discovered… I like their annual reading challenge… I like to see what other people are reading and I would enjoy some of the conversation sections
Martha: Looked it up on my computer. Great concept but too much going on. A bit overwhelming to maneuver for me.
Margaret: I am typically put off by a website that wants me to create a free account so up front on the first page - feels like you want my contact info that you may not deserve.  Brb - message from Anna....I would put www.GoodReads.com as top name...Wording feels a little awkward - what about offering your service i.e. Need help picking your next book?
Baba: I'm not following. I'm a Goodreads person already so on mobile it asked me to sign in ;)
Michael: Went to the mobile site on my phone and it required me to download the app.  I have no interest in the app without first seeing the site!
Stuart: Good reads - didn't look like a very efficient way to find a good book.  Also I'm not sure how it differs from the recommendations I get from Amazon and Audible.  I don't see a benefit.

Ideation Initialization- More competition driven content with a stronger social messaging component.   Possibly a Toms movement. Buy a book , send a book to a needy individual in the zipcode of your choice.
